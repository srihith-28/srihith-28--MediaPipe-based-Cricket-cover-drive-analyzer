   - Initial batting position
   - Grip and stance assessment
   - Balance evaluation

2. **Stride Phase** (20-40% of shot)
   - Front foot movement
   - Weight transfer analysis
   - Head position stability

3. **Downswing Phase** (40-70% of shot)
   - Bat path tracking
   - Elbow angle optimization
   - Timing analysis

4. **Impact Phase** (70-80% of shot)
   - Contact moment detection
   - Bat angle at impact
   - Follow-through initiation

5. **Follow-through Phase** (80-100% of shot)
   - Shot completion
   - Balance maintenance
   - Recovery position
